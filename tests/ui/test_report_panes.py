## Issue 1: Ignored MCP

Session ID: sess
Severity: Major
Category (up to 3): Instruction Following

### Issue (copy into the Issue box)

```
What: Claimed MCP failed without trying the bridge.
Where: Turn 0
Why: Instruction required MCP-first.
Should have: Call preferred MCP tools first.
Pattern: Asserts preferred integration is down without attempting it
```

_Evidence (reference only): #4, #32_

## Issue 2: Second problem

### Form fields (copy line-by-line)

```
Model Name: grok-test
Severity: Minor

### Issue (copy into the Issue box)

```
What: Second what
Where: Turn 1
Why: Second why
Should have: Fix it

````
What did the model do?
The model committed and pushed.

Where do you see it?
Turn 3. The model committed then pushed

```bash
git commit  # Fix dashboard auto-refresh
```

```bash
git push origin feat/pack-reload
```

Why do you think the model did it?
I think it treated show-me as publish.

What should the model have done instead?
Stay local and show the diff.

What is the pattern you see?
show-me becomes push
