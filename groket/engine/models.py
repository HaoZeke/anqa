"""Detection matches and findings.

**One concept for analysis output:** :class:`~groket.analysis.base.Finding`.

Detectors return lightweight :class:`Match` values; the runner turns each match
plus rule YAML into a :class:`Finding` (``plugin_id="rules"``, ``id`` = rule id).
Composites (optional user YAML) attach as parent findings with children.
