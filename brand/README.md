# groket identity 1.2

Three-bar rocket for the groket product. Each bar is a turn; the cap is
that turn’s status. The nose sits on the complete (green) bar so the
rocket flies toward success. The short bar is running (yellow); the
other long bar is failed (red). The **small mark** is that rocket without
needles: a 7×3 character grid so a terminal and a browser tab match.
Open **[guidelines.html](guidelines.html)** for colour, type, sizes, and
which file to use.

The approved still is `source/approved.jpg`. The shippable mark is the
SVG drawn by `build.py` — not a tracing of the still.
